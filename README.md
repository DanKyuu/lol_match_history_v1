# lol_match_history_v1
This code was created by me during a post-graduation project for FIA.

The repo is being used as storage for some data that I collected.
This is my second try using some data about the match history from top players in League of Legends from every server.
What is expected to try in this project is up to debate, but I am trying to create a model to predict player victory probability for Machine Learning Engineer Course in Udacity.
